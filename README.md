# 🐱 Mew

Mew is a project generator that allows you to create JavaScript projects with a single command that have all the features you would expect. It's still in development and not yet functional, but you can follow the project and contribute to its development.

The goal of Mew is to make setting up a new JavaScript project as simple as running a single CLI command. To accomplish this, Mew includes a variety of templates and utilities, such as loggers and universal configs, that can be customized using inquirer prompts.

## 💾 Installation

Since Mew is not yet functional, there is currently no installation process. However, once it is ready for use, you will be able to install it by running the following command:

```bash
npm install -g @mew/cli
```

## 🚀 Usage

Once Mew is functional, you will be able to create a new JavaScript project with the following command:

```bash
mew create templateName
```

Replace templateName with the name of one of the available templates. Mew will then prompt you for any necessary configuration options for the chosen template.

Once the configuration is complete, Mew will create a new directory with the specified template and configuration.

## 📂 Templates

Mew will include the following templates in it's first release:

    basic: a basic JavaScript project with an index.js file and a package.json
    react: a React project with a package.json, index.html, and index.js file

More templates will be added in the future.
